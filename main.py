    #     These are the steps you will need to complete:

    #            Make sure to pass the device argument to the noise.
    #       2) Get the discriminator's prediction of the fake image
    #            and calculate the loss. Don't forget to detach the generator!
    #            (Remember the loss function you set earlier -- criterion. You need a
    #            'ground truth' tensor in order to calculate the loss.
    #            For example, a ground truth tensor for a fake image is all zeros.)
    #       3) Get the discriminator's prediction of the real image and calculate the loss.
    #       4) Calculate the discriminator's loss by averaging the real and fake loss
    #            and set it to disc_loss.
